# Diffusion-limited aggregation playground

Try the online version [here](https://thanosfisherman.github.io/dla-experiments/) or download the desktop binaries from the releases section [here](https://github.com/ThanosFisherman/dla-experiments/releases)

## What's this?

It's my take on **Diffusion-limited aggregation** algorithm (DLA) using a two-dimensional **Brownian motion** with an **off-lattice** approach to generate tree-like structures out of randomness...


OK enough with the buzzwordary. It's just a bunch of pixels flying around randomly while eventually getting stuck together. Read more about it from the links attached at the end.
DLA, is an extraordinarily simple computer simulation although a **VERY CPU intensive** one as it turns out. Fortunatelly I made a ***bLaZiNgLy FAST*** ðŸš€ desktop version. The web version is slower but it's a rather easy and nice way to get an idea of the simulation.

## Usage

* Press **Spacebar** to start/pause the simulation
* Press **D** to debug
* Press **H** to show/hide moving particles
