# Diffusion-limited aggregation playground

Try the online version here or download the desktop binaries from the releases section here

## What's this?

It's my take on **Diffusion-limited aggregation** algorithm (DLA) using a two-dimensional **Brownian motion** with an **off-lattice** approach to generate tree-like structures out of randomness...


OK enough with the buzzwordary. It's just some pixels flying around randomly while eventually getting stuck together. Read more about it from the links attached at the end.
DLA, is an extraordinarily simple computer simulation but **VERY CPU intensive** as it turns out. Fortunatelly I made a ***bLaZiNgLy FAST*** ðŸš€ desktop version. The web version still sucks though but it's a rather quick and nice way to get an idea of the simulation.

## Usage

* Press **Spacebar** to start/pause the simulation
* Press **D** to debug
* Press **H** to show/hide moving particles
